## Purpose

This repository is a **neutral resource hub** for the iGaming niche (slots, sportsbook, live casino, lottery). It’s designed to:

* Keep a tidy, credible list of **official resources** and **partner links**.
* Make backlink insertion **predictable** and **transparent** (editorial vs. sponsored vs. UGC).
* Provide **compliance cues** (18+, jurisdiction disclaimers, responsible gambling).
* Offer optional scripts to **check link health** at scale.

> **Note:** GitHub may apply `rel="nofollow"` to external links in Markdown. If you also host this content on **GitHub Pages** (as HTML), your custom `rel` attributes will be preserved. See [SEO Notes](#seo-notes-for-github-vs-github-pages).

---

## Quick Start

1. **Clone or fork** this repo.
2. Open **README.md** and replace placeholders (brand names, URLs, contact info).
3. Add links in the sections below. Use **editorial** for genuine recommendations, **sponsored** when paid, **UGC** for community submissions.
4. (Optional) Mirror the same links into an `index.html` for **GitHub Pages** if you want control over `rel` attributes.

---

## Backlink Zones (where to place links)

**Zone A — Intro (Contextual):** High‑value, short paragraph with 1–2 links placed naturally in the opening.

**Zone B — Editorial Resources:** Curated list of trusted references (informational, reviews, guides). These are typically *dofollow* when you control the HTML (e.g., GitHub Pages) and not paid.

**Zone C — Partners / Sponsored:** Paid placements; must be disclosed. Use `rel="sponsored nofollow"` when you control the HTML.

**Zone D — UGC:** Community recommendations. Use `rel="ugc"` when you control the HTML.

**Zone E — Footer Mentions:** Lower priority but useful for discovery and navigation.

> **Tip:** Keep **anchor text natural** (brand or branded long‑tail). Avoid aggressive exact‑match keyword stuffing.

---

## Insert Your Backlinks

### Zone A — Intro

Trusted resources for regulated iGaming: **[Example Brand](https://example.com "Example Brand Official")** offers updated links, and **[Example Review Hub](https://example.org "Example Review Hub")** provides independent comparisons.

> Replace the two links above with your primary targets.

### Zone B — Editorial Resources

Use this section for genuine recommendations (editorial). Add 3–10 links.

* [Brand A — Official Site](https://brand-a.example "Brand A Official") — overview, official promos, KYC.
* [Brand B — Fair Play & RNG Policy](https://brand-b.example/policy "Brand B RNG Policy") — outlines testing & fairness.
* [Brand C — Sportsbook Rules](https://brand-c.example/rules "Brand C Sportsbook Rules") — bet types, settlement.

### Zone C — Partners / Sponsored

Disclose commercial relationships here.

* **Sponsored:** <a href="https://partner-a.example" title="Partner A" rel="sponsored nofollow">Partner A — Welcome Offer</a>
* **Sponsored:** <a href="https://partner-b.example" title="Partner B" rel="sponsored nofollow">Partner B — VIP Program</a>

### Zone D — Community (UGC)

Links submitted by community members (moderated).

* <a href="https://community-pick.example" title="Community Pick" rel="ugc">Community Pick — Strategy Forum</a>

### Zone E — Footer Mentions

Additional navigational mentions.

* [Regulatory Authority List](https://authority.example "Regulators") · [Testing Labs](https://labs.example "Accredited Labs") · [RG Tools](https://rg-tools.example "Self‑exclusion & Limits")

## Markdown list (fast)

Paste your targets here for quick publishing (Markdown will be nofollow on GitHub UI):

```md
- [Moto555 — Official Site](https://moto555.com "Moto555")
- [YES855 — Online Casino](https://yes855.org "YES855")
- [Daya138 — Slot Hub](https://daya138.example "Daya138")
```

> Replace with your own brands/URLs. Keep titles human and unique.

---

## HTML list with `rel` attributes (for GitHub Pages / websites)

If you deploy to **GitHub Pages** or another site where you control HTML, use this block so rel‑attributes are preserved:

```html
<ul>
  <!-- Editorial (default, dofollow) -->
  <li><a href="https://moto555.com" title="Moto555 Official" rel="noopener">Moto555 — Official Site</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://yes855.org" title="YES855" rel="noopener">YES855 — Online Casino</a></li>

  <!-- Sponsored (disclose) -->
  <li><a href="https://partner.example/offer" title="Welcome Offer" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener">Partner — Welcome Offer</a></li>

  <!-- UGC (community) -->
  <li><a href="https://forum.example/threads/strategy" title="Community Strategy" rel="ugc noopener">Community Strategy Thread</a></li>
</ul>
```

> **Security:** Always include `rel="noopener"` on links that might open in a new tab.

---

## Editorial Style & Anchor Text Guide

* Prefer **branded** or **brand+context** anchors: `Moto555 sportsbook guide`, `YES855 slots overview`.
* Use **natural language** in surrounding sentences; place 1–2 links per \~100–150 words.
* Avoid repetitive exact‑match anchors (e.g., “best online casino Indonesia”) across many links.
* Keep **links above the fold** for your primary targets; use footer for secondary mentions.
* Refresh links **quarterly**; remove dead/outdated pages.

---

## Compliance & Responsible Gambling

* **18+ only.** Gambling involves risk. Play responsibly.
* Respect **local laws & licensing**; availability varies by jurisdiction.
* Provide RG resources: [BeGambleAware](https://www.begambleaware.org/), [NCPG](https://www.ncpgambling.org/), and local regulators.
* Disclose **sponsorships/affiliations** clearly in the README.

You may add a short disclosure like:

> **Disclosure:** Some links are sponsored. We may receive compensation if you sign up through them. This supports our content at no extra cost to you.

## Link Health Check (optional scripts)

Use these simple scripts to verify URLs and status codes before committing.

### Python script

```python
# link_check.py
import sys, requests

TIMEOUT = 10

urls = [
    "https://brandA.example",
    "https://brandB.example",
    "https://brandc.example",
]

ok, bad = [], []
for u in urls:
    try:
        r = requests.get(u, timeout=TIMEOUT, allow_redirects=True)
        (ok if 200 <= r.status_code < 400 else bad).append((u, r.status_code))
    except Exception as e:
        bad.append((u, str(e)))

print("OK:")
for u, s in ok:
    print(f"  {u} -> {s}")
print("\nIssues:")
for u, s in bad:
    print(f"  {u} -> {s}")
```

Run:

```bash
python3 link_check.py
```

### Node.js script

```js
// link-check.mjs
import fetch from "node-fetch";

const urls = [
  "https://moto555.com",
  "https://yes855.org",
  "https://daya138.example",
];

for (const u of urls) {
  try {
    const res = await fetch(u, { redirect: "follow" });
    console.log(`${u} -> ${res.status}`);
  } catch (e) {
    console.log(`${u} -> ERROR: ${e.message}`);
  }
}
```

Run:

```bash
node link-check.mjs
```

## SEO Notes for GitHub vs GitHub Pages

* **GitHub README (Markdown):** External links in the UI are typically treated as `nofollow/ugc` by platforms; treat this as **brand mention + referral traffic**, not PageRank.
* **GitHub Pages (HTML):** You control markup; your chosen `rel` attributes (e.g., `sponsored`, `ugc`, or default editorial) will be preserved. Consider mirroring this README’s link blocks into an `index.html` page for better control.
* Use **UTM parameters** for partner tracking where allowed.
